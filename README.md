# Vespera Publishing — The Rack

A static, JSON-powered comic library and reader. It displays PNG/JPG/WebP pages and can insert short MP4/WebM videos anywhere in the reading sequence.

## Run it

Browsers usually block `fetch('rack.json')` when `index.html` is opened directly as a `file://` URL. Serve the folder with any static web server:

```bash
cd vespera-the-rack
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

**Tailnet (NXCore):** https://nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net/the-rack/  
Open access on Tailscale only (no login, no public Funnel). Remodel SOS deep link: `#/read/remodel-sos-volume-1/1`

Deploy: `compose-the-rack.yml` + `nginx-the-rack.conf` (see `SOT.json`).

It also works from nginx, Apache, Cloudflare Pages, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages, or any ordinary static host.

## Add a comic

1. Create a content folder:

```text
content/my-comic/
├── pages/
│   ├── 001.png
│   ├── 002.png
│   └── 003.png
└── video/
    ├── moment-01.mp4
    └── moment-01-poster.jpg
```

2. Copy the sample structure from `rack.example.json` into `rack.json`.
3. Set the cover image and list every image/video in the exact order it should appear.
4. Refresh the page. No compilation or build step is required.

## Supported sequence items

### Image

```json
{ "type": "image", "src": "content/my-comic/pages/001.png", "alt": "Page 1" }
```

### Video

```json
{
  "type": "video",
  "src": "content/my-comic/video/moment-01.mp4",
  "poster": "content/my-comic/video/moment-01-poster.jpg",
  "caption": "A moment between pages",
  "autoplay": false,
  "muted": false,
  "advanceOnEnd": true
}
```

For mobile compatibility, use H.264 video with AAC audio in an MP4 container. Keep clips under roughly 30 seconds and compress them for web delivery.
